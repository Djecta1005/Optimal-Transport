# Optimal Tranport For Recommandation systems
Here is an implementation of a Collaborative Recommender systems which is built on a Random dataset and MovieLens dataset. This Recommandation system was built using python and it's inspired from this article: 
- https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume20/18-700/18-700.pdf 

and these githubs: 
- https://github.com/BorisMuzellec/TROT

## Dependencies:
 ````
 numpy, pandas, scipy, pyspark, sklearn
 ```` 
 
## What to execute ??
### For Random Dataset:
- RandomDatasetNoises.py to see the effect of relaxation parameter (noisesEffect.png)
- RandomDatasetLamdas.py to see the effect of regulization parameter (lamdasEffect.png)
- RandomDatasetMatrix.py to plot the different matching/cost matrixes
### For MoviesLen Dataset:
- The jupyter notebook MovieRatings.ipynb
